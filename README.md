# Blueprints_Case_Study

[Blueprints for Pangaea](https://www.blueprintsforpangaea.org/) is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit medical surplus recovery organization (MSRO) that provides sustainable solutions to inefficient health care resource distribution. Currently all the inventorying is done by hand in the warehouse and the inventory is being kept on a google spreadsheet. The goal of this case study is to clean up the current inventory data of over 67,000 items and 2,000+ data points. Then extract how frequent certain items appear, % of items come from X company, and of all the items from X company, what are the top three. The data from this case study will be used in a future project to help speed up the manual inventorying process potentially saving hundreds of hours of volunteer time.

## Description

The goal of this study is to help speed up the inventorying process by creating a list of the most common items and most common manufacturers that is given to us from donations. Also a little bit to help me hone my SQL and R skills for data aggregation and visualization. This is my first case study and did play around with the visualizations.
